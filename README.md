# üëã Hello there, I'm Yi-Ping!

I'm passionate about functional programming and I enjoy diving deep into compiler engineering. Currently, I'm dedicated to building an exciting project: the RISC-V emulator called **rv32emu**.

## About Me

- üíª Compiler Engineer
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Love for Functional Programming

## Current Project: [rv32emu](https://github.com/your_username/rv32emu)

**rv32emu** is a RISC-V emulator project where I'm exploring the intricacies of processor architecture and emulation techniques. Join me on this journey as we delve into the world of RISC-V and create something amazing together!
