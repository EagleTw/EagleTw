# Welcome to The Cloudlet
*A quiet space for tools, thoughts, and timeless flows.*

**About Me**

Hi, I'm **Cloudlet** — a calm builder, compiler whisperer, and systems thinker.  
I like writing tools that reduce friction, code that breathes, and notes that last.

**Ongoing Projects**

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `coogle` | A C++ source navigator using libclang — search your codebase by signature. |

**Specializing in**

- Compiler and toolchain design (C++, VHDL, Verilog)
- High peferformance optimization
- Refactoring large regression flows with clarity
- Building a calm developer workflow with Emacs, Org-mode, and maybe... VSCode

**Connect**

I’m slowly building my digital garden —  
but if you’d like to reach out, just leave a star, open an issue, or say hi.
